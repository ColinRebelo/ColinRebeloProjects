        <h3>My name is Colin Rebelo, and I am a recent graduate from Ontario Tech University, with a BSc(Hons) in Computer Science. 
            Throughout my experience at Ontario Tech University, I have worked with many different individuals with a variety of work styles,
            allowing for me to adapt to many different styles of team leadership and development processes. I learned to code in many different languages
            utilizing both Linux, and Windows, and I am adept at taking on new languages and software. I enjoy solving problems and applying my knowledge to 
            help myself and others create easy to understand and efficient code.
            <br>
            <br>
            Growing up I always had a fascination with technology, whether it be through game consoles, computers, digital cameras or speakers, I was always looking to incorporate
            more technology into my life. 
            I believe hobbies that will provide a challenge are the most fulfilling, and as such, most of my pasttimes are focused on brain activity and hand-eye coordination. These include a competitive fighting game, 
            that motivates me to strive for improvement, and allows me to notice flaws in my preformance that I can further develop. It also helps foster a competitive attitude, as I am always seeking new challenges, regardless
            of any new obstacles. I also play the piano, as it allows me to develop memory and proper pacing skills, as well as allowing me to further improve my hand-eye coordination and cognitive ability. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Another pasttime that provides a challenge is solving questions provided by 'Project Euler'. These coding questions that require knowledge of both mathematics, and software programming
            are something I began to work on and solve shortly after finishing my final examinations for university. 
            I believe it provides both a challenging and rewarding experience, as it also allows me to develop the mathematics aspect of programming, alongside sustaining and improving my knowledge of coding.
