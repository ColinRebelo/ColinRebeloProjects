        <h3>
            Many of my larger scale team-projects include a website developed with HTML, CSS, Pug, and javascript that recommends games based on a user
            profile or user query, including the use of MongoDB to store the data, and compressing the data to lower the size needed to allow the site to function efficiently.
            Another large scale team-project I developed was a mobile application coded with dart, and flutter that would allow users to track and locate local bird species, 
            and customize a profile that allows the user to track previous sightings to allow for easier bird watching navigation. Throughout both of these endeavors, I have used
            my experience to further develop my ability to work as both a leader, and as a team player. I am confident in my ability to use time management to ensure quality code and product
            without extending past set deadlines.
            <br>
            <br>
            I have also worked on many individual projects throught my university career, allowing me to develop stronger skills involving critical thinking, time management, situational analysis,
            working under pressure for individual responsibility. I am interested in developing code for both front-end interfaces and back-end systems. I also enjoy solving problems and applying 
            that knowledge to create well-documented and optimized code. I have confidence in my knowledge in many different coding languages, and I am adept at taking on new languages and software. 
            I work efficiently individually and collaborate well as part of a group effort, both as a leader and a follower.
